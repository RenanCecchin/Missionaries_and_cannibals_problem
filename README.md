# Missionaries and Cannibals problem

This project aims to solve the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem using various algorithms and techniques. The problem involves three missionaries and three cannibals who must cross a river using a boat that can only carry two people at a time. The challenge is to find a sequence of valid moves that allows all the missionaries to cross the river without ever leaving a group of missionaries outnumbered by cannibals on either side. 

# Instructions to run the code

You can run the code by using

```
python main.py [individuals_number] [boat_capacity]
```

The two arguments are optional but you can use them to interact with the problem
